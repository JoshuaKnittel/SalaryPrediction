# Salary prediction
A machine learning model to predict the salaries of software developers. Deployed with Flask.
 
## Machine learning model
A detailed variant of the model is included in the [jupyter notebook](https://github.com/JoshuaKnittel/SalaryPrediction/blob/main/jupyter_notebook/detailed_model.ipynb). This notebook contains comments, visualizations and an error analysis. 

The [model.py](https://github.com/JoshuaKnittel/SalaryPrediction/blob/main/model.py) contains the same model in a shortened form. Based on this file the Flask application is created.
